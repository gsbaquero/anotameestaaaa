Code like it’s working
Comment like someone’s actually gonna read it.
Debug like you didn’t write it at 2 a.m.
hopped up on caffeine and existential dread.
Push to prod like it’s a test branch
because hey, what’s the worst that could happen?
And when it breaks, just blame the comments
They clearly misled you.
